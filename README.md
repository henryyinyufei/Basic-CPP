# CMPT 129 Introduction to computing science and programming for mathematics and statistics

## Calendar description

A second course in computing science and programming intended for students studying mathematics, statistics or actuarial science and suitable for students who already have some background in computing science and programming. Topics include: a review of the basic elements of programming: use and implementation of elementary data structures and algorithms; fundamental algorithms and problem solving; basic object-oriented programming and software design; computation and computability and specification and program correctness.

## Topics

* C/C++ review of ifs/loops, basic input and output using C++
* Writing simple functions, arguments passed by value and by reference
* File input and output, error handling,
* 1 and 2-D arrays
* Pointers, dynamic allocation of arrays, using arrays as function arguments
* Recursion
* Linear and binary search, algorithms for methods of sorting, Empirical comparison of sorting methods
* Introduction to classes
* Data structures (some as examples of classes), stacks, hash tables, linked lists
